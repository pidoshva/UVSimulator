# TeamVoid-UVSim
UVSim Program (CS2450)

# File: main.cpp
    main() {
        initialize the terminal window.
        display the directions on the terminal to the user.
        a loop that prompts the user to input commands for execution.
        -- store the commands on RAM/file etc.
        execution happens in vm.cpp.
        dump the results in console (Feature 6).
        terminate the program.
    }

# File: vm.cpp 
    VM stands for virtual machine. It will retrieve the opcodes and the memory locations and execute the insturctions.
        a loop that ends when no instructions are left to execute.
        retrieve the instruction from the file where the instructions are stored.
        load the instruction into IR (Instruction Register).
        create switch/if statements for instruction identification:
        -- if opcode == 10 (READ):
        ---- go to instructions.cpp /READ -> perform the operation -> go back to vm.cpp.
        increment the PC (Program Counter or Instruction Counter).

# File: instructions.cpp
    Contains instructions for execution.
    VM will use this file to execute the instructions it retrieves from a file that stores all the instructions the user inputed.

## Example:
### READ:
    user_input = int(input()) // if user inputs an integer
    memory[memory_location] = user_input // memory_location is the last two bits of the instruction that the user inputs.
                                        // it is retrieved by VM and passed as an argument to the READ instruction.

# File: memory.cpp:
    The file contains a data structure with 100 memory locations and the values in each memory location.
    It also contains IR (Instruction Register), IC (Instruction Counter), A (Accumulator) registers and their values.
    Some other files are interconnected with this file.
    Sort of like a dictionary in python:
    Example:
    {00: 00001, ..., 99: 00000}
    Or a simple array: [00001, 00005, ...]

# Ideas for user stories:
## US1: in instructions.cpp:
    Task1:  implement IO operations.
    Task2:  implement Load/Store operations.
    Task3:  implement Arithmetic operations.
    Task4:  implement Control operations.
## US2: in memory.cpp:
    Task1:  implement a data structure for memory and create three other registers (IR, IC, A).

## US3: in vm.cpp:
    Task1:  create a loop that will retrieve each instruction and load into IR.
    Task2:  create switch statements for IO operations.
    Task3:  create switch statements for Load/Store operations.
    Task4:  create switch statements for Arithmetic operations.
    Task5:  create switch statements for Control operations.
    Task6:  increment IC.

## US4: in main.cpp:
    Task1:  Set up skeleton of Code base as outlined in this document (make each file and function name).

    Task2:  initialize the terminal window.
            display the directions on the terminal to the user.

    Task3:  a loop that prompts the user to input commands for execution.
            store the commands on RAM/file etc.
